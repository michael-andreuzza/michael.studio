          Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside
          down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you
          how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
        </p>

        <p>
          In West Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I
          spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool And all
          shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who
          were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in
          one little fight and my mom got scared She said, "You're movin' with
          your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
        </p>

        <p>
          I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suitcase
          and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my
          ticket I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it"
        </p>

        <p>
          But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type
          of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see
          when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked
          like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get
          arrested yet, I just got here I sprang with the quickness like
          lightning, disappeared I whistled for a cab and when it came near The
          license plate said, "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror If anything
          I could say that this cab was rare But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo,
          holmes to Bel Air"
