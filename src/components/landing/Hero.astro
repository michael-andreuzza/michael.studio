          Michael is a true rarity, effortlessly bridging the realms of design
          and coding. His designs are masterfully polished, striking a perfect
          balance between being on trend and remaining distincltly original. The
          advantage we gained from having Michael iterate on designs directly in
          code far surpassed our expectations. We firmly believe that this
          approach, which eliminates the need for multiple design steps, not
          only accelerates the process but also yields superior results.

          Michael has helped me with many designs, and I couldn't follow his
          working speed when we worked together. His designs are slick, and he
          delivers a lot of value; he is constantly iterating his designs and
          making improvements.
